# Ban-Things

To use, download the release and unzip in your explorer. The app should be labeled as "Cryog's Ban App." Downloading the code is if you want to add your own features, it won't download the actual app! (program used was Unity).

Thanks for using this app! If you use this for videos please credit @Cryog on YT.
